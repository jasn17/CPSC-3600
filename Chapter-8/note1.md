# What is network security?
CIA Traid plus AAA model
- CIA triad - information security model 
    - **Confidentiality-Integrity-Avaliability**
    - Only avaliable to view to intended person, is correct and untampered with, is avaliable when I need it
    - three principles are cornerstone of secuirty infrastructure
    - also tenets of cyber security
- AAA 
    - methods to achieve cybersecuirty objectives 
    - Authentication, Authoirzation, and Accountibility
    - Are you the person inteneded to view this information Are you authroized to read, write, and exectute? Are you accountible to what happens to the computer system?

# Friends and Enemeis: Alice, Bob, Trudy
- A and B are commmunicating, T is intruder
- What can a bad guy do?
    - eavesdrop (Opening cars without the key)
    - insert messages into connection
    - impersonation (pretend to be someone else)
    - hijacking
    - denial of service

# Breaking Encryption Scheme
- Cipher only attack
    - Trudy has ciphertext she can analyze
- Two approaches
    - **Brute force** search through all keys
    - **Statistical analysis** 
- Known-plain text attack
    - trudy has plaintext corresponding to ciphertext

# Symmetric Key Cryptography
